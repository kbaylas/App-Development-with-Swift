 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let name = "Kaan"
print("Names are always remain the same unless you change it on court :)")
var age = 26
print("As year goes by your age will increase...")
var numberOfStepsTakenToday = 12305
print("As you keep moving during the day this value should be updated everytime you take a step")
let goalNumberOfSteps = 15000
print("This goal probably decided by the user for daily goal, should remain the same")
var averageHeartRate = 110
print("Your heart rate won't remain the same through the day so your average heart rate value should mutable")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
